The Text::FastTemplate class requires Perl version 5.004_05 or above.  In the
future, this could change to require version 5.005 or above.

Install this module the same way as any other Perl module.

	1.  perl Makefile.PL
	2.  make test
	3.  make install

Don't forget the PREFIX option if you don't have permission to write into the
default directories on your Perl installation.  Many people forget about this;
then they either give up or ask their sys admin to install it for them.

Try this instead:

	1.  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=$HOME/perl-modules
	2.  make test
	3.  make install
